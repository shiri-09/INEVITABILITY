**The cybersecurity industry spends $188B/year answering _"What might happen?"_**
**INEVITABILITY answers _"What MUST happen?"_**

<br/>

> 🔬 **Formal verification meets offensive security.**
> Instead of probabilistic risk scores, INEVITABILITY uses Z3 SMT solving over Structural Causal Models
> to compute mathematically provable inevitability scores — proving which breaches are structurally
> guaranteed given your current infrastructure topology.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Traditional Security Tools
```
❌ Probabilistic risk scores
❌ "This MIGHT happen"
❌ Reachability analysis only
❌ Cannot prove control necessity
❌ Security theater goes undetected
```

</td>
<td width="50%">

### INEVITABILITY
```
✅ Mathematical proof of inevitability
✅ "This MUST happen — here's the proof"
✅ Causal necessity analysis via SMT
✅ Proves which controls actually matter
✅ Detects and quantifies security theater
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Core insight:** If removing a security control doesn't change the inevitability score of any attack goal, that control is **security theater** — structurally irrelevant regardless of its vendor rating, compliance checkbox, or annual cost.

## 🔮 Core Features

### 🧮 Causal Solver Engine
The heart of INEVITABILITY — encodes your entire infrastructure as a **Structural Causal Model** and uses Microsoft's **Z3 SMT solver** to compute whether an attacker's goal is *structurally inevitable* given your current control state.

- **Boolean satisfiability** over causal graphs
- **Witness path extraction** — the exact node sequence that makes a goal inevitable
- **Intervention modeling** — toggle controls on/off and recompute in real-time

### ⚔️ Minimal Causal Sets (MCS)
Identifies the **smallest set of controls** whose failure makes a goal inevitable. Unlike traditional attack graphs, MCS gives you the mathematically minimal failure combination.

### 🎭 Security Theater Detection
Automatically identifies controls that are **structurally irrelevant** — controls that, even if removed, don't change any goal's inevitability score. These are your security theater: expensive, compliance-satisfying, but causally meaningless.

### 🔄 Counterfactual Engine
**"What if we had enabled this control?"** — Recompute the entire causal model under hypothetical interventions. Proves whether a proposed change would have *structurally prevented* a breach.

### 💰 Economic Impact Analysis
Maps causal analysis to dollars:
- **Cost per control** vs. **risk reduction achieved**
- **ROI scoring** for defense investments
- **Wasted spend detection** on theater controls

### 🌊 Collapse Simulation
Visualizes how infrastructure unravels when controls fail — frame-by-frame collapse animation showing cascading failures from initial compromise to full breach.

### 📝 Explainability Layer
Generates human-readable proof narratives: *"Goal X is inevitable because controls A, B, and C are all inactive. Even with B enabled, the path through D remains unblocked."*

## 🧬 Real-World Breach Reconstruction

INEVITABILITY includes **6 meticulously reconstructed breach scenarios** with full causal graphs:

| Breach | Year | Inevitability | Key Insight |
|--------|------|:------------:|-------------|
| 🌐 **SolarWinds** | 2020 | `0.92` | Supply chain + SAML forgery = email exfiltration was structurally guaranteed |
| 🏦 **Capital One** | 2019 | `0.78` | SSRF → IMDS → IAM role — a 3-hop chain with no causal blocking |
| 🔐 **Okta / Lapsus$** | 2022 | `0.85` | Third-party contractor with superuser access = 366 tenants exposed |
| 🪵 **Log4Shell** | 2021 | `0.95` | JNDI injection → RCE → cloud creds. Most controls were causally irrelevant |
| 📊 **Equifax** | 2017 | `0.97` | Unpatched Struts + flat network + plaintext creds = 76 days undetected |
| 🏢 **Enterprise Demo** | 2024 | `0.65` | Synthetic enterprise with AD, cloud, CI/CD — multiple attack surfaces |

> Each scenario includes full **attack path reconstruction**, **control mapping**, and **counterfactual analysis** showing which single controls could have prevented the breach.

## ⚡ Advanced Capabilities

### 🎯 Multi-Goal Strategic Optimization
Computes **Pareto-optimal defense strategies** across multiple simultaneous attack goals. Finds the cheapest set of controls that reduces all goal inevitability below threshold, ranked by ROI.

### 🏅 Certification Engine
Generates formal **security posture certification reports** with:
- Letter grades (A–F) based on structural analysis
- Per-goal pass/fail verdicts with proof artifacts
- Exportable findings with severity ratings

### 📈 Failure Forecasting
Projects how inevitability scores will **drift over time** based on common infrastructure degradation patterns:
- Privilege creep (8%/month)
- Identity sprawl (5%/month)
- Patch decay (3%/month)
- Configuration drift (4%/month)

### 💥 Goal Collision Analysis
Detects **interactions between multiple attack goals**:
- **Synergies** — fixing one goal's controls helps another
- **Conflicts** — fixing one goal worsens another
- **Independence** — goals are causally isolated

### 🔴 Adversarial Defense Testing
Red team simulation that finds the **optimal attack strategy** given current defenses. Identifies which single control bypass would be most devastating — your single points of failure.

## 🔒 Model Limitations

- **Topology Accuracy** — Results are only as reliable as the infrastructure model fed into the system. An incorrect or incomplete causal graph will produce misleading inevitability scores.
- **Known Techniques Only** — The solver operates over modeled attack paths. Zero-day exploits and novel TTPs outside the graph are not captured.
- **Static Snapshot** — Analysis reflects a point-in-time topology. Dynamic environments (auto-scaling, ephemeral workloads) require re-modeling to stay accurate.
